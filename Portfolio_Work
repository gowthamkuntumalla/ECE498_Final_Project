Portfolio Work: 

1. 4 years (2013 - 2017) data --> created using Kmeans++ (seed and correlation minimization using prices) and weights optimization

split--> Train: 2013 - 2017 data (4years), Unseen: 2017 - 2018 data (1year)

2. Portfolios to compare:
Say you create these portfolios at the beginning of 2017.

1 : static only past 4 years
2 : top 10 stocks (in the future 1 year - 2017 to 2018) using regression prediction.
3 : using portfolio optimization using next 1 year (just like portfolio 1)
4 : dynamically (every quarter) rebalancing the weights of the portfolio 1

3. Compare the Returns/$100 for all these 4 portfolios with unseen 1 year (2017 - 2018)  --> Testing
